# MS Connectome fMRI

This project explores functional brain network disruptions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using resting-state fMRI data and graph theory.

## Features

- Preprocessing of fMRI data using Nilearn and fMRIPrep
- Construction of functional connectivity matrices
- Graph-theoretical analysis (e.g., global efficiency, modularity)
- Visualization of altered networks

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Add fMRI dataset to the `data/` folder
3. Run the preprocessing and analysis scripts in `scripts/` or `notebooks/`

## Tools Used

- Python
- Nilearn
- NetworkX
- fMRIPrep
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

This project is part of my neuroscience and computational neuroimaging portfolio.
